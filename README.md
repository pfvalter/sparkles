# sparkles
Spark App Framework, reduces the need to have boilerplate and write a lot of foundation code just to create a Spark Data Pipeline project.

Planned milestones:
- Implement the generics to be able to create a job (done)
- Introduce file formats
- Introduce file type inference
- Add read options
- Introduce code formaters (scalafmt maybe?)
- Create the code to be able to run jobs in memory, s3, etc.
- Introduce the HList concept to allow for multiple ins and outs without the need of extra boilerplate
- Implement the submission SDK for AWS
- Add support for Dataframes (json and dataframes are not good friends)
- Implement cluster monitoring and other orchestration needed EMR SDK
